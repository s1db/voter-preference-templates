Iterative Copeland:
    - VOTERS/AGENTS -> the agents that rank/score the different candidates.
    - CANDIDATES -> the set of solutions that the different agents rank/score.
    - Cadidates are added in each iteration.
    - Our aim is do better than recomputing the whole matrix at each iteration.
    - Numpy is avoided to study the computational complexity of the whole program.
    - Once done, check if it gives the same output when the candidates are shuffled.
    - Present literature claims that Copeland Method is NP.
    - We want to check if adding a new candidate iteratively is also NP with a constant number of agents.
        - It's computationally cheaper than I thought! 
    - We also want to check if its better than recomputing the whole matrix.

PROJECT NOTE:
    - the rankings will either need to be recomputed at each iteration, or we'll need to use an ordinal approach.
        - Iteratively adding candidates would technically require a recompute of all rankings.
    - Incase of the ordinal approach, utility of each voter needs to be normalized.
    - ML literature has many ways scores can be computed and normalized to mitigate bias.
    - This can also be defied as a reasonable constraint on the problem at hand.

OPEN QUESTIONS NOTE:
    # Could rankings be replaced with utility scores?
    # How does that affect the copeland method?
    # Refer to chapter 10 of comsoc.
